## Scope

- Please indicate which category or categories from our [package fit policies](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#package-categories) this package falls under: (Please check an appropriate box below. If you are unsure, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry.):

	- [ ] data retrieval
	- [ ] data extraction
	- [x] data munging
	- [ ] data deposition
	- [ ] workflow automation
	- [ ] version control
	- [ ] citation management and bibliometrics
	- [ ] scientific software wrappers
	- [ ] field and lab reproducibility tools
	- [ ] database software bindings
	- [ ] geospatial data
	- [ ] text analysis

- Explain how and why the package falls under these categories (briefly, 1-2 sentences):

The Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) may look like a simple questionnaire, but it requires a lot of date/time manipulation. This can be really challenging, especially if youâ€™re dealing with a large set of data. `mctq` provides reliable tools, thoroughly tested, to help scientists with that task.

-   Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?

`mctq` was designed for researchers in the field of sleep and chronobiology. The scientific applications of the package are the same as the scale it addresses, _i.e._ to assess peoples' sleep behavior and characteristics of circadian rhythms.

-   Are there other R packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ or meet [our criteria for best-in-category](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#overlap)?

No other packages do the same thing (to my knowledge).

-   (If applicable) Does your package comply with our [guidance around _Ethics, Data Privacy and Human Subjects Research_](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#ethics-data-privacy-and-human-subjects-research)?

I don't think this is applicable to our package.

-   If you made a pre-submission enquiry, please paste the link to the corresponding issue, forum post, or other discussion, or @tag the editor you contacted.
