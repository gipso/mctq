## Overview

`mctq` provides a consistent and fast way to process Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) data in R for all of its three versions (standard, micro, and shift).

Please note that this package have not been [peer reviewed](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html) yet. We plan to submit it to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) in March 2021.

<!-- ### About MCTQ -->

<!-- __UNDER DEVELOPMENT__ -->

<!-- To learn more about the standard Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ), _cf._ Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice, & Merrow (2003), Roenneberg, Allebrandt, Merrow, & Vetter (2012), Roenneberg _et al._ (2015), and Roenneberg, Pilz, Zerbini, & Winnebeck (2019). -->

<!-- To know about different MCTQ versions, _cf._ Juda, Vetter, & Roenneberg (2013) and Ghotbi _et.al_ (2020). -->

<!-- If you curious about the variable computations and want to have access to the full questionnaire, _cf._ The Worldwide Experimental Platform (n.d.). -->

### Wait, a R package for a questionnaire?

If you're familiar with MCTQ, you know that it's not a simple questionnaire, as it requires a lot of date/time manipulation. That can be real challenging, especially if you're dealing with a large set of data.

The main advantage to use the `mctq` package in your research is that you will have reliable tools, thoroughly tested, at your disposition, made and supported by a sleep science research group (GIPSO) from a well know university ([USP](https://www5.usp.br/)). `mctq` also helps with research reproducibility, since it's a free and open source package that anyone can find and use.

This package is also equipped with several utility functions that allows you to easily convert and visualize your MCTQ data. It also provides fictional datasets for testing and learning purposes.

## Installation

The first stable `mctq` version is already out, we hope that it will be available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) soon. Until that moment comes, you can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gipsousp/mctq", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Usage

`mctq` works with a set of object classes specially created to hold time values. This classes can be found in the [hms](https://hms.tidyverse.org/) and [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) package from [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/). If your data do not conform to the object classes required, don't worry, just use `convert()` to convert it. You can always convert it back if you want.

Here are some examples of how to convert your data using `convert()`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# From decimal hours to `hms`
convert(6.5, "hms", input_unit = "H")
# From radians to `Duration`
convert(1.308997, "Duration", input_unit = "rad")
# From radians to decimal minutes
convert(0.2617994, "numeric", input_unit = "rad", output_unit = "M")
# From `character` `HMS` to `Duration`
convert("19:55:17", "Duration", orders = "HMS")
# From `character` `HM AM/PM ` to `hms`
convert("10:00 PM", "hms", orders = "IMp")
```

### Basic MCTQ computation

After your data is all set, just use the `mctq` functions below to process it. 

Note that `mctq` uses a similar naming scheme as those used in the MCTQ articles, that make it easy to find and apply any computation necessary.

* `fd()` compute MCTQ work-free days
* `so()` compute MCTQ sleep onset
* `gu()` compute MCTQ local time of getting out of bed
* `sd()` compute MCTQ sleep duration
* `tbt()` compute MCTQ total time in bed
* `ms()` compute MCTQ mid-sleep
* `napd()` compute MCTQ nap duration (only for MCTQ Shift)
* `sd24()` compute MCTQ 24h sleep duration (only for MCTQ Shift)

Example:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Local time of preparing to sleep on workdays
sprep_w <- c(hms::parse_hms("23:45:00"), hms::parse_hms("02:15:00"))
# Sleep latency or time to fall asleep after preparing to sleep on workdays
slat_w <- c(lubridate::dminutes(30), lubridate::dminutes(90))
# Local time of sleep onset on workdays
so(sprep_w, slat_w)
```

### MCTQ analysis

For computations combining workdays and work-free days, use:

* `sd_week()` compute MCTQ average weekly sleep duration
* `sd_overall()` compute MCTQ overall sleep duration (only for MCTQ Shift)
* `sloss_week()` compute MCTQ weekly sleep loss
* `le_week()` compute MCTQ average weekly light exposure
* `msf_sc()` compute MCTQ chronotype or corrected mid-sleep on work-free days
* `sjl()` and `sjl_rel()` compute MCTQ social jet lag
* `sjl_weighted()` compute MCTQ absolute social jetlag across all shifts (only for MCTQ Shift)

Example:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Local time of mid-sleep on workdays
msw <- c(hms::parse_hms("02:05:00"), hms::parse_hms("04:05:00"))
# Local time of mid-sleep on work-free days
msf <- c(hms::parse_hms("23:05:00"), hms::parse_hms("08:30:00"))
# Relative social jetlag
sjl_rel(msw, msf)
```

### Utilities

In addition to `convert()`, `mctq` is also equipped with many other utility functions. 

All functions are well documented, showing all the guidelines behind the computations. Click [here](https://gipsousp.github.io/mctq/reference/index.html) to see a list of them.

## Citation

If you use `mctq` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open source R package. You can find `mctq` citation below.

```{r}
