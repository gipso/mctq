__UNDER DEVELOPMENT__

Shows the rationale behind the MCTQ, its different versions, and how to handle them with the `mctq` package.

Why a mctq package? What are the advantages to use it? (big datasets, consistency, avoid common data issues, community development ...)

The MCTQ\eqn{^{Shift}}{ Shift} can be adapted for other work schedules. If that is your case, don't worry, the `mctq` package can be used with any shift combination.
