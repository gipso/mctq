This article shows some notes about different approaches that can be used to compute the social jetlag ($SJL$) for the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). It also explains how the `method` argument from the `sjl()` function  works.

It's a good idea to have the standard MCTQ questionnaire and the guidelines for the standard MCTQ variable computation open while reading this article/vignette. That way you can have a better understanding of the data objects we are going to deal with. You can download a copy of the MCTQ full standard version  [here](https://www.thewep.org/documentations/mctq/item/english-mctq-full).

## The two intervals problem

According to Roenneberg, Allebrandt, Merrow, & Vetter ([2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.03.038)) supplemental materials, the relative social jetlag ($SJL_{ rel}$), _i.e._ the discrepancy between social and biological time, must be computed as the difference between the $MSF$ (local time of mid-sleep on work-free days) and $MSW$ (local time of mid-sleep on workdays).

$$SJL_{rel} = MSF - MSW$$

This simple equation may seems trivial, until you take into account that you're are dealing with two hour values detached from a timeline. In other words, $MSW$ and $MSF$ represents two moments in two different contexts (one on workdays and the other on work-free days).

If you dive into the MCTQ articles, you can see that this computation have two objectives:

1. To represent the distance between $MSW$ and $MSF$ (_i.e._ the discrepancy).
2. To establish what value comes before or after the other, representing that with a $+/-$ signal. That is, when $MSW$ comes before $MSF$, $SJL_{rel}$ must be positive, and when $MSW$ comes after $MSF$, $SJL_{rel}$ must be negative.

You can find the rationale about the $SJL_{rel}$ signal in Roenneberg, T., Pilz, L. K., Zerbini, G., & Winnebeck, E. C. ([2019](http://doi.org/10.3390/biology8030054)) (see item "3.2 Social Jetlag Computation").

Most people have some trouble to understand this. To illustrate what we mean, let's visualize a timeline overlapping a $MSW$ and $MSF$ value:

```
             day 1                        day 2
    MSF                MSW       MSF                MSW
   05:00              21:00     05:00              21:00
-----|------------------|---------|------------------|----->
              16h           8h             16h
          longer int.  shortest int.   longer int.

```

Note that, while doing the representation above, we are dealing with the assumption that $MSF$ and $MSW$ can be represented in a two day timeline, since subjects don't usually sleep more than 24 hours (basic assumption).

As you can see, by overlapping two hour values in a two day timeline, we need to make a choice of what interval to use. For most people $MSF$ and $MSW$ is close to each other, so, usually, we are looking for the shortest interval between the two hour values. But, in some extreme cases, usually when dealing with shift workers, $MSF$ and $MSW$ distance can surpasses 12h, making the longer interval the correct answer.

To obtain the signal of $SJL_{rel}$ we must check the start value of the interval. If the interval between $MSW$ and $MSF$ starts with $MSW$, that means that $MSW$ comes before $MSF$, hence, the signal must be positive. Else, if the interval between $MSW$ and $MSF$ starts with $MSF$, that means that $MSW$ comes after $MSF$, hence, the signal must be negative.

* Example 1: when $MSF - MSW$ makes a __positive__ $SJL_{rel}$


```
             day 1                        day 2
                       MSW       MSF                
                      21:00     05:00
------------------------|---------|------------------------>

```

* Example 2: when $MSF - MSW$ makes a __negative__ $SJL_{rel}$


```
             day 1                        day 2
                       MSF       MSW                
                      21:00     05:00
------------------------|---------|------------------------>

```

We call this the __two intervals problem__. It represents a unsolvable mathematical scenario, if you deprive it from the subject context. That can generate minor errors when computing `sjl`, specially if you're dealing with large datasets.

## Methods for computing $SJL_{rel}$

The `sjl()` function provides a argument called `method` that allow you to choose three different methods to deal with the two intervals problem. Here's how they work.

### `method = "difference"`

By using `method = "difference"`, `sjl()` will do the exact computation proposed by the original authors, _i.e._ $SJL$ will be computed as the linear difference between  $MSF$ and $MSW$.

Let's see some examples using this method.

* Example 3: using the `"difference"` method

$MSW = \text{04:00}$

$MSF = \text{06:00}$

$\text{Real difference: + 02:00}$

$MSF - MSW = \text{06:00} - \text{04:00} = \text{+ 02:00}$ (__right__)

* Example 4: using the `"difference"` method

$MSW = \text{23:00}$

$MSF = \text{03:00}$

$\text{Real difference: + 04:00}$

$MSF - MSW = \text{03:00} - \text{23:00} = \text{- 20:00}$ (__wrong__)

As you can see with the second example, the `"difference"` method uses a linear approach, creating problems regarding the circularity of time.

### `method = "shortest"`

By using `method = "shortest"`, `sjl()` uses the shortest interval between $MSF$ and $MSW$. The `"shortest"` method is the default method for `sjl()`.

That's the most reliable method we found to compute $SJL$, considering the context of MCTQ data. However, it comes with a limitation: when $MSW$ and $MSF$ values distance themselves by more than 12 hours, `sjl()` can return a wrong output. By our experience with MCTQ data, a $SJL_{rel}$ greater than 12 hours is highly improbable.

Let's see some examples using this method.

* Example 5: using the `"shortest"` method

$MSW = \text{04:00}$

$MSF = \text{06:00}$

$\text{Real difference: + 02:00}$

```
             day 1                        day 2
    MSF                MSW       MSF                MSW
   06:00              04:00     06:00              04:00
-----|------------------|---------|------------------|----->
             22h            2h             22h
         longer int.  shortest int.    longer int.

```

Since $MSW$ comes before $MSF$ using the shortest interval, $SJL_{rel} = \text{+ 02:00}$ (__right__).

* Example 6: using the `"shortest"` method

$MSW = \text{23:00}$

$MSF = \text{03:00}$

$\text{Real difference: + 04:00}$

```
             day 1                        day 2
    MSF                MSW       MSF                MSW
   03:00              23:00     03:00              23:00
-----|------------------|---------|------------------|----->
             20h            4h             20h
         longer int.   shortest int.   longer int.

```

Since $MSW$ comes before $MSF$ using the shortest interval, $SJL_{rel} = \text{+ 04:00}$  (__right__).

* Example 7: when the `"shortest"` method fail

$MSW = \text{12:00}$

$MSF = \text{23:00}$

$\text{Real difference: - 13:00}$

```
             day 1                        day 2
    MSW                     MSF                      MSW
   12:00                   23:00                    12:00
-----|-----------------------|------------------------|----->
               11h                       13h
           shortest int.             longer int.

```

Since $MSW$ comes before $MSF$ using the shortest interval, $SJL_{rel} = \text{+ 11:00}$ (__wrong__).

You can see example 7 in the `shift_mctq` dataset provided by the `mctq` package (ID 39, on night shifts). That's the only MCTQ$^{Shift}$ case in `shift_mctq` where we think that the `"shortest"` method would fail.

### `method = "longer"`

By using `method = "longer"`, `sjl()` uses the longer interval between $MSW$ and $MSF$. It's the opposite of the `"shortest"` method showed above.

## So, what method shoud I use?

We recommend that you always use the `"shortest"` method when computing $SJL_{rel}$ (the default `sjl()` method). That way is almost guaranteed that you have the right result.

In our tests, the `"shortest"` method demonstrated to be almost fail-safe. You really need to worry about the $SJL_{rel}$ computation if you are dealing with shift workers.

When dealing with a large MCTQ$^{Shift}$ dataset, it will be very difficult to identify $SJL$ errors, unless you look case by case and check the results with your volunteers. That's usually not a viable option, hence, we recommend that you mention which method you use to compute $SJL_{rel}$ and add it as a possible limitation of your results.
