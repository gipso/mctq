```
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  ChronoType (2:36, 46:55)
  MCTQ (2:62, 47:20, 48:5)
  Merrow (50:30)
  Roenneberg (49:59)

```
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
```
As noted in [R-hub issue #503](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503), this 
could be due to a bug/crash in MiKTeX and can likely be ignored.

These could be due to a temporary failure in the web servers and can likely be ignored. I checked all the links and DOIs and they are working normally.

## revdepcheck results (Windows 11 install (v. 22H2))

There were no reverse dependencies.

```
We checked 0 reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN 
and dev versions of this package.

* We saw 0 new problems
* We failed to check 0 packages
```

## goodpractice results (Windows 11 install (v. 22H2))

```
â™¥ Ole! Awesome package! Keep up the super work!
```
