#' @section Class requirements:
#'
#' The `mctq` package works with a set of object classes specially created to
#' hold time values. This classes can be found on the [hms::hms-package] and
#' [lubridate::lubridate-package]. If your data do not conform to the object
#' classes required, you can use [mctq::convert()] to convert it
#' (see `vignette("converting-data", package = "mctq")`).
