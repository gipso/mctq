#' @section Class requirements:
#'
#' The `mctq` package works with a set of object classes specially created to
#' hold time values. These classes can be found in the [hms][hms::hms-package]
#' and [lubridate][lubridate::lubridate-package] package. If your data do not
#' conform to the object classes required, you can use the `mctq`
#' [mctq::convert()] function to convert it.
