\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#maturing}{\figure{lifecycle-maturing.svg}{options: alt='[Maturing]'}}}{\strong{[Maturing]}}

\code{sjl()} computes the \strong{relative or absolute social jetlag} for standard,
micro, and shift versions of the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ).

\code{sjl_rel()} it's just a wrapper for \code{sjl()} with \code{abs = FALSE}.

\code{sjl_sc()} is a function to compute the Jankowski's (2017) social jetlag
sleep-corrected proposal. It works exactly as \code{sjl()}, but with \code{so_w} as
\code{msw} and \code{so_f} as \code{msf}. Learn more about it in the sections below.

\details{
\strong{Standard MCTQ} functions were created following the guidelines in
Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice, & Merrow (2003), Roenneberg, Allebrandt, Merrow, &
Vetter (2012), and from The Worldwide Experimental Platform (theWeP, n.d.).

\strong{\eqn{\mu}MCTQ} functions were created following the guidelines in Ghotbi
et al. (2020), in addition to the guidelines used for the standard MCTQ.

\strong{MCTQ\eqn{^{Shift}}{ Shift}} functions were created following the
guidelines in Juda, Vetter, & Roenneberg (2013), in addition to the
guidelines used for the standard MCTQ.

\subsection{Class requirements}{

The \code{mctq} package works with a set of object classes specially created to
hold time values. These classes can be found in the
\link[lubridate:lubridate-package]{lubridate} and \link[hms:hms-package]{hms}
packages. Please refer to those package documentations to learn more about
them.
}

\subsection{Rounding and fractional time}{

Some operations may produce an output with fractional time (e.g.,
\code{"19538.3828571429s (~5.43 hours)"}, \code{01:15:44.505}). If you want, you
can round it with \link[=round_time]{round_time()}.

Our recommendation is to avoid rounding, but, if you do, make sure that you
only round your values after all computations are done. That way you avoid
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error}{round-off errors}.

\section{Guidelines}{


Roenneberg, Allebrandt, Merrow, & Vetter (2012), Juda, Vetter, & Roenneberg
(2013), and The Worldwide Experimental Platform (n.d.) guidelines for \code{sjl()}
(\eqn{SJL_{rel}}{SJL_rel} and \eqn{SJL}) computation are as follows.
\subsection{Notes}{
\itemize{
\item For MCTQ\eqn{^{Shift}}{ Shift}, the computation below must be applied to
each shift section of the questionnaire.
\item Due to time arithmetic issues, \code{sjl()} does a slightly different
computation by default than those proposed by the authors mentioned above.
See \code{vignette("sjl-computation", package = "mctq")} for more details.
\item If you are visualizing this documentation in plain text (\code{ASCII}), you may
have some trouble understanding the equations. If you want a better viewer,
you can see this documentation on the package
\href{https://docs.ropensci.org/mctq/reference/}{website}.
}
}

\subsection{For standard and micro versions of the MCTQ}{

Relative social jetlag (\eqn{SJL_{rel}}{SJL_rel}):

\strong{\deqn{MSF - MSW}}

Absolute social jetlag (\eqn{SJL}):

\strong{\deqn{| MSF - MSW |}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{MSW} = local time of mid-sleep on workdays.
\item \eqn{MSF} = local time of mid-sleep on work-free days.
}

\strong{*} \eqn{W} = workdays; \eqn{F} = work-free days.
}

\subsection{For the shift version of the MCTQ}{

Relative social jetlag (\eqn{SJL_{rel}}{SJL_rel}):

\strong{\deqn{MSF^{M/E/N} - MSW^{M/E/N}}{MSF_M/E/N - MSW_M/E/N}}

Absolute social jetlag (\eqn{SJL}):

\strong{\deqn{| MSF^{M/E/N} - MSW^{M/E/N} |}{| MSF_M/E/N - MSW_M/E/N |}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{MSW^{M/E/N}}{MSW_M/E/N} = local time of mid-sleep between two days in
a particular shift.
\item \eqn{MSF^{M/E/N}}{MSF_M/E/N} = local time of mid-sleep between two free
days after a particular shift.
}

\strong{*} \eqn{W} = workdays; \eqn{F} = work-free days, \eqn{M} =
morning shift; \eqn{E} = evening shift; \eqn{N} = night shift.
}
}

\section{Jankowski's social jet lag sleep-corrected proposal}{


In an article published in 2017, Konrad S. Jankowski argued that the original
formula for computing the social jet lag (\eqn{SJL}) captures not only the
misalignment between social and biological times, but also sleep debt
resulting from sleep deprivation during workdays. Jankowski than proposed the
following guideline for the \code{sjl_sc()} (\eqn{SJL_sc} computation.
\subsection{Notes}{
\itemize{
\item The Jankowski's alternative is still disputed. We recommend seeing
Roenneberg, Pilz, Zerbini, & Winnebeck (2019) discussion about it
(see item 3.4.2).
\item For MCTQ\eqn{^{Shift}}{ Shift}, the computation below must be applied to
each shift section of the questionnaire.
\item Due to time arithmetic issues, \code{sjl()} does a slightly different
computation by default than those proposed by the authors mentioned above.
See \code{vignette("sjl-computation", package = "mctq")} for more details.
\item If you are visualizing this documentation in plain text (\code{ASCII}), you may
have some trouble understanding the equations. If you want a better viewer,
you can see this documentation on the package
\href{https://docs.ropensci.org/mctq/reference/}{website}.
}
}

\subsection{For standard and micro versions of the MCTQ}{

\strong{\deqn{| SO_F - SO_W |}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{SO_F} = local time of sleep onset on workdays.
\item \eqn{SO_W} = local time of sleep onset on work-free days.
}

\strong{*} \eqn{W} = workdays; \eqn{F} = work-free days.
}

\subsection{For the shift version of the MCTQ}{

\strong{\deqn{| SO_F^{M/E/N} - SO_W^{M/E/N} |}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{SO_F^{M/E/N}} = local time of sleep onset between two days
in a particular shift.
\item \eqn{SO_W^{M/E/N}} = local time of sleep onset between two free
days after a particular shift.
}

\strong{*} \eqn{W} = workdays; \eqn{F} = work-free days, \eqn{M} =
morning shift; \eqn{E} = evening shift; \eqn{N} = night shift.
}
}

\section{Methods for computing the social jetlag}{


There are different approaches to compute the social jetlag (\eqn{SJL}). By
default, \code{sjl()} uses an approach that we call "the shorter interval
approach" (\code{"shorter"}).

The topics below provide a simple explanation of each method supported by
\code{sjl()}. To get a detail understating of this methods, see
\code{vignette("sjl-computation", package = "mctq")}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"difference"}
}

By using \code{method = "difference"}, \code{sjl()} will do the exact computation
proposed by the MCTQ authors, i.e., \eqn{SJL} will be computed as the linear
difference between \eqn{MSF} and \eqn{MSW} (see the Guidelines section).

\strong{We do not recommend using this method}, as it has many limitations.
\itemize{
\item \code{"shorter"}
}

This is the default method for \code{sjl()}. It's based on the shorter
interval between \eqn{MSW} and \eqn{MSF}, solving most of the issues
relating to \eqn{SJL} computation.
\itemize{
\item \code{"longer"}
}

The \code{"longer"} method uses the same logic of the \code{"shorter"} method, but,
instead of using the shorter interval between \eqn{MSW} and \eqn{MSF}, it
uses the longer interval between the two, considering a two-day window.

This method may help with special contexts, like when dealing with
shift-workers that have a greater than 12 hours distance between their
mid-sleep hours.
}

\section{Missing sections in standard and micro MCTQ versions}{


Although the standard and micro versions of the MCTQ asks for respondents to
complete the workdays and work-free days sections, even when they do not
have a regular work schedule (\code{wd = 0}) or have a 7 day/week work schedule
(\code{wd = 7}), some of them may still end skipping one of this parts of the
questionnaire. In those cases, \code{sd_week()}, \code{sloss_week()}, \code{le_week()},
\code{msf_sc()}, \code{sjl_rel()}, and \code{sjl()} will produce \code{NA} (Not Available) as
output. That's because those computations combine workdays and work-free days
variables.

For those special standard and micro MCTQ cases, where one section is
missing, a \code{NA} value is the correct output for the functions mentioned above
when \code{wd} (number of workdays per week) are \code{wd > 0 & wd < 7}, but it may not
be when \code{wd == 0} or \code{wd == 7}. There are different approaches to deal with
this issue. See \code{vignette("missing-sections", package = "mctq")} to learn
more.
